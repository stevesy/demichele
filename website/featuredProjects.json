We found a property in Milwaukee&rsquo;s Park Place development and conducted an RFP with the building owner (Liberty Property Trust). After negotiating a very strong lease interest in the property, The DeMichele Company acted as Owner&rsquo;s Representative to build out the 32,000 square foot property.
